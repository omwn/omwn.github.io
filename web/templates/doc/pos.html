<p>Princeton WordNet defines the original four open class parts of
  speech: either noun, verb, adjective, or adverb. It later added
  satellite adjectives, which are in clusters representing a concept that is
  similar in meaning to the concept represented by its head synset.
  OMW maps them internally to adjectives.

<p>Conjunctions and adpositions are reserved for extending to new
  semi-open classes.

<p><strong>x</strong> is used for non-referential words such as
  particles, classifiers, exclamatives, greetings, determiners and so forth.

<p><strong>z</strong> is used for phrases, for example to
  represent <i>phrasets</i>, introduced by <a href='Beyond Lexical
  Units: Enriching Wordnets with Phrasets'>Luisa Bentivogli and
    Emanuele Pianta (2003)</a>.
  <br><strong>DEPRECATED</strong> better to
  use <strong>lexicalized</strong> instead.
  
<p><strong>u</strong> Is for automatically produced wordnets that want
  to add words for which they are not sure of the part-of-speech.

  <h4>Non-lexicalized Synsets and Senses</h4>
  
<p>We have an optional attribute <code>lexicalized</code>
on the synset and sense types, with a boolean value, defaulting to
true. This was inspired by the Basque and MultiWordNet projects.

<p>If a synset is marked as lexicalized <code>False</code> then it means it has no
lemmas, and this is a deliberate decision on the part of the wordnet
builders (but the synset may be included to keep the hierarchy in sync
with other projects). For example the synset <i>dedos</i> "fingers and toes"
in Spanish would be <code>lexicalized=false</code>
  in English.

<p>If a sense has lexicalized <code>True</code>
  then it has been validated in some
standard lexicon for the language. If it has lexicalized <code>False</code>, then
it is believed to be compositional and only added as an aid to
multilingual users (similar to <i>phrasets</i> in multiwordnet). For example
<i>harimau anak</i> "young tiger" in the Indonesian synset for tiger cub is
<code>lexicalized=false</code>, or <i>dedos pedas</i> "foot
finger-and-toes" in the synset for toe in Spanish.

  We have added some new possibilities.
