        <h1>Wordnet Topics</h1>

	<p>This page provides documentation for the coarse
	  classification originally used by the Princeton Wordnet to
	  divide senses up.  We call them <b>topics</b>, they are
	  originally called <tt>lexicographic file names</tt> and have
	  also been called <tt>semantic fields</tt> and <tt>super-senses</tt>.
	
<p>In Princeton Wordnet, at the top level, nouns are organized into 25
beginner "trees" for nouns and 15 for verbs (called lexicographic
files). All are linked to a unique beginner
synset, "entity". Noun hierarchies are far deeper than verb
hierarchies. Adjectives are not organized into hierarchical
trees. Instead, two "central" antonyms such as "hot" and "cold" form
binary poles, while 'satellite' synonyms such as "steaming" and
"chilly" connect to their respective poles via a "similarity"
relations. The adjectives can be visualized in this way as "dumbbells"
rather than as "trees".

  We have expanded the definitions of some of the files.
